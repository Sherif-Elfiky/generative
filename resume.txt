• Debugged production issues across auth, data access, and API layers to improve reliability and user experience
Monterey Peninsula College Feb 2022 - Jul 2022
Computer Science Tutor Monterey, Ca
• Administered 1 hour Computer Science study sessions to improve scores on tests
• Addressed students’ confusions on various practice problems
• Increased students scores on tests by 10 percent
PROJECTS
News Verified Python, React, Next.js, FastAPI, PyTorch, BeautifulSoup4, Machine Learning
• Developed an AI powered tool that summarizes and analyzes articles for bias
• Integrated BART models for summarization and zero shot classification using Hugging Face Transformers
• Built RESTful APIs with FastAPI and connected them to a responsive React frontend for smooth real time feedback
• Created responsive UI with loading states, error handling, and live classification results with confidence scoring visual ization
• Implemented OAuth 2.0 with Google Sign In via NextAuth.js to ensure secure, authenticated access
• Deployed automated development and deployment workflows for cross platform compatibility
Video clipping automation pipeline Puppeteer, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Youtube Data API
• Built an end to end Node.js system that orchestrates headless browser workers (Puppeteer) to automate multi-step web workflows 
where no public API was available.
• Designed a job queue with Express and MongoDB, exposing REST endpoints for job submission and tracking state transitions 
(queued, processing, done) for observability and recovery.
• Implemented resilient automation with selector timeouts, structured retries, and per job page resets, enabling workers to process 
multiple jobs per browser session without manual authentication.
• Integrated YouTube Data API to discover source content and enqueue jobs incrementally, enabling continuous, rate limited clip 
generation.
• Documented production tradeoffs (polling vs push queues, browser reuse vs isolation, input typing vs direct value setting) and paths 
to scale.
DoorDash ETA Python, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, Keras
• Utilizes 197k observations and 16 features to predict DoorDash wait times
• Compared multiples machine learning models such as linear regression, and neural networks to predict wait times
• Created a custom time to deliver target feature by transforming timestamp columns into numerical values for regression modeling
• Applied hyperparameter tuning to increase reliability of predictions
• Developed and tuned deep neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras with ReLU, ELU, and Leaky ReLU activations, incorporating 
early stopping and grid search
• Found diminishing returns from increasing model complexity, leading to conclusions about missing contextual features (e.g., weather, 
restaurant-specific delays) affecting ETA accuracy
